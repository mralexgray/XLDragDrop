This is an encapsulation of NSView Drag & Drop APIs (NSDraggingDestination). If you want to add functionalities like dragging files in, consider to use XLDragDrop.

This is written with ARC (Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting) enabled, and therefore does not support either gcc or llvm-gcc. Please use Apple LLVM Compiler (3.0 or later).

Build. Add XLDragDrop.framework to your project.

Implementation:
  Initialize XLDragDropView with -initWithFrame:normalBackgroundImageName:. Don't forget to set highlightedBackgroundImageName and acceptedBackgroundImageName after initialization. Then implement delegate methods in your controller class.
